# Blackjack Project

This is a basic Blackjack game made in python as my first "program". The code focuses on the use of classes in order to solidify my learning.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thanks the people from [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and especially to [n-sweep](https://github.com/n-sweep) because without his help and patience in teaching this program would not be possible.
